								<h2>Who we are</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								ABHA Care Services is an organisation built on the principle of delivering compassionate, high-quality care to our aged care and NDIS participants. We are committed to fulfilling the Aged Care and NDIS Quality Standards to ensure the highest level of service to our participants. These standards are not just guidelines; they are the foundation of the care we provide and essential to maintaining our legal and ethical responsibilities.

									<h3>Patient-Centred Care Approach</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									Our focus is on treating every participant with dignity and respect while prioritising their independence and right to make informed choices. In line with Standard 1: participant Dignity and Choice, we will ensure that all care plans reflect the individual identity, cultural preferences, and values of each participant. We have trained our staff to engage with participants in a way that empowers them to make their own decisions about their care, with particular attention to personal privacy and informed consent.
								</p>

									<h3>Personalised Care Plans</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									At ABHA Care Services, we recognise that each participant's needs are unique and ever-evolving. In accordance with Standard 2: Assessment and Planning, our staff will develop and review personalised care plans that align with participants' needs, goals, and preferences. Our assessment processes will be culturally sensitive and involve participants and their representatives in all key decisions. These plans will be reviewed regularly to ensure any changes in health or preferences are addressed immediately.

									<h3>Safe, Effective, and Best-Practice Care</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									We are committed to providing the highest standards of personal and clinical care, as outlined in Standard 3: Personal and Clinical Care. Our care delivery will adhere to best practices in areas such as nutrition management, medication safety, pain management, and the prevention of pressure injuries. We will also minimise restrictive practices, ensuring participants can live with dignity while respecting their choices regarding the risks they may wish to take in life.

									<h3>Culturally Safe and Inclusive Services</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									Our company values diversity and is committed to offering care that is culturally safe, as per Standard 1’s emphasis on Identity, Culture, and Diversity. Our staff will receive ongoing training to ensure they understand and respect the cultural, spiritual, and social preferences of every participant. We will continuously review our policies to eliminate bias, stereotypes, and discrimination, ensuring that all participants feel valued and safe.

									<h3>Commitment to Continuous Improvement</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									We recognise that delivering quality care is an ongoing process. Our organisation will establish a robust feedback and monitoring system, involving both participants and staff, to regularly assess our performance against the Quality Standards. This will help us identify areas for improvement and ensure that we not only meet but exceed the expectations set forth by the Aged Care Quality Standards.
								</p>
								<p>
									At ABHA Care Services, we take our legal and moral obligations seriously and with the collective efforts of our dedicated workforce, we will continue to provide safe, effective, and respectful care that honours the dignity of every participant we serve.
